### Programming Basics
The "Programming Basics" course provides basic programming skills required for all technology majors at the Software University. This includes writing basic coding skills, working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), using conditional constructions (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).

### Programming Fundamentals
With "Programming Fundamentals" students begin to study SoftUni's internal program for comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in professional modules. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex programming techniques and structures such as arrays, worksheets, objects and classes. Additional technologies needed by each software developer, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations and others, are studied.The basics of web development are reviewed, as well as one of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds students' understanding of upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful software developers.

### Programming Advanced
In the JS Advanced course, you will gain in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, such as syntax basics, working with arrays, objects, classes, and writing functions. You will study more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop your algorithmic thinking. After successfully completing this course, you will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, to manipulate it and to work with "events". The functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be considered, and concepts such as inheritance, object composition and prototype chain will be studied.
